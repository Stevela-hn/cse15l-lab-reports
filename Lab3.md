# An exploratory view of `grep` as the command-line tool

This report aims to extend on course material about `grep` in CSE 15L and provide a comprehensive view of this tool. There're mainly two parts, the first one introduces the file structure that the author is experimenting in, and the second one follows a series of 8 examples that contains four command-line options or alternate ways to use the command, each of which has two examples.

## Part 1 - File Structure / Setting
The files consists of several folders that contains text-as-data as `.txt` files, which includes conference papers and records. Our working directory will be mostly in the `./technial` project. The project comes with four categories of data in `technical` folder - `911 report`, `biomed`, `government` and `plos`. It is highly possible that not all of the four folders of data will be applied in this report. But at least some of them leave us a good practice on the command tools. Below attached a tree representation of the folder structure: note that the author intentionally ignored some java files and bash files to make the overall structure more clear.

```
- docsearch
  - technical (working dir)
    - 911report
      - .txt files
    - biomed
      - .txt files
    - government
      - 6 sub-categories
        - .txt files
    - plos
      - .txt files
```

## Part 2 - Exploratory `grep`
This section aims to give 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use `grep`, each comes with two examples.

### Section 0: A brief introduction to basic `grep`
`grep` is a command-line tool in Bash that is used for searching through text files for lines that contain a specific pattern or string. The name "grep" stands for "global regular expression print". It takes one or more patterns as input and searches through one or more files or standard input, displaying any lines that contain the specified pattern.
