# An exploratory view of `grep` as the command-line tool

This report aims to extend on course material about `grep` in CSE 15L and provide a comprehensive view of this tool. There're mainly two parts,
the first one introduces the file structure that the author is experimenting in, and the second one follows a series of 8 examples that 
contains four command-line options or alternate ways to use the command, each of which has two examples.
